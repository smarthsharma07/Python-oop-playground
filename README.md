# Python OOP Mini Projects

This repository contains Python projects built while learning and
practicing Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## 🧩 Mini OOP Projects
Small focused projects primarily built to practice classes, objects,
constructors, methods, and validation.

### 1. Music Instrument Simulator
- Demonstrates class creation and instance methods
- Uses `__init__`, `play()`, and `get_fact()`

### 2. Planet Simulation
- Models planets using a `Planet` class
- Implements `__str__()` and lifecycle methods
- Includes type and value validation

### 3. Email Simulator
- Simulates email sending using classes
- Focus on object interaction

## 💼 Major Project: Budget App
A larger project that applies OOP concepts to a real-world use case.

**Features:**
- Income and expense tracking
- Category-based budgeting
- Persistent data storage (optional)
- Clean class-based design

This project is more complete and complex compared to the mini projects
and represents a step toward production-level code.
